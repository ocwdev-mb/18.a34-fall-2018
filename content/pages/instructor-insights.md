## Instructor Insights

Professor Yufei Zhao, who took _18.A34 Mathematical Problem Solving (Putnam Seminar)_ as an undergraduate at MIT and was a three-time Putnam Fellow, has gone on to a flourishing career in mathematics:

Under his coaching, MIT students have been remarkably successful in the [Putnam Competition](http://math.scu.edu/putnam/):

Below, Professor Zhao describes various aspects of how he teaches the Putnam Seminar.

{{< quote "It is an incredibly satisfying feeling to struggle with an interesting problem and eventually solve it." "— Yufei Zhao" >}}

**OCW**: How do you cultivate and sustain students’ interest in problem-solving?

**Yufei Zhao:** By exposing them to interesting problems that hook them. It is an incredibly satisfying feeling to struggle with an interesting problem and eventually solve it.

**OCW**: What strategies do you use to promote students’ perseverance during problem-solving?

**Yufei Zhao:** I try to show them how the problems we discuss are related to more advanced mathematics and help them see the big picture. (Of course, in research, the time horizon is much longer than in math competitions!)

**OCW**: In what ways does the Putnam Seminar create a sense of community among learners engaged in problem-solving?

**Yufei Zhao:** Each week one of the classes is a lecture (often guest lectures by upper-level undergraduates who have previously done well in the Putnam Competition) and the other class is for student presentations of homework problems. The student presentations really help in building the sense of community. During student presentations, the other students in the class often comment and point out flaws or gaps in the arguments presented. I also try to encourage good presentation skills.

## How Student Time Was Spent

During an average week, students were expected to spend 6 hours on the course, roughly divided as follows:

### In Class

- Met 2 times per week for 1 hour per session; 26 sessions total; mandatory attendance
- First session each week: usually a lecture, delivered by an upper-level undergraduate
- Second session each week: student presentations of solutions to homework problems
- Last five class sessions: student presentations of solutions to past Putnam Competition problems and to student-created Putnam-type problems

### Out of Class

- Completion of at least 6 problems each week, drawing on the week’s topic-based problem sets and sets of supplementary problems
- Preparation for in-class presentations
- Preparation for Putnam Competition
