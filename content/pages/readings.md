Below are some useful links related to mathematical problem solving.

Alexanderson, Gerald L., Leonard F. Klosinski, and Loren C. Larson. _The William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition Problems and Solutions, 1965–1984_. Washington, DC: Mathematical Association of America, 1985. ISBN: 9780883854419.  
All Putnam problems for the period 1965–1984, with rather brief solutions (which were originally published in the _American Mathematical Monthly_).

Barbeau, Edward, Murray S. Klamkin, and W. O. J. Moser. _Five Hundred Mathematical Challenges_. Washington, DC: Mathematical Association of America, 1997. ISBN: 9780883855195.  
Mathematics is at the high school level, but many problems will still be challenging to undergraduates.

Gilbert, George Thomas, Mark Krusemeyer, and Loren C. Larson. _Mathematical Plums_. (Dolciani Mathematical Expositions, no. 14.) Washington, DC: Mathematical Association of America, 1979. ISBN: 9780883853009.

Gleason, Andrew M., R. E. Greenwood, and L. M. Kelly. _The William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition Problems and Solutions 1938–1964_. Washington, DC: Mathematical Association of America, 1980. ISBN: 9780883854280.  
Consists of solutions to all Putnam problems during the period 1938–1964. Very good exposition with lots of motivation, connections with more general areas, etc.

Greitzer, Samuel L. _International Mathematical Olympiads, 1959–1977_. (New Mathematical Library, no. 27.) Washington, DC: Mathematical Association of America, 1979. ISBN: 9780883856277.

Halmos, Paul R. _Problems for Mathematicians, Young and Old_. (Dolciani Mathematical Expositions, no. 12.) Washington, DC: Mathematical Association of America, 1991. ISBN: 9780883853207.  
I haven't seen this, but it should be quite entertaining.

Honsberger, Ross. _Mathematical Morsels_. (Dolciani Mathematical Expositions, no. 3.) Washington, DC: Mathematical Association of America, 1979. ISBN: 9780883853030.  
Contains 91 problems (with solutions) obtained from various mathematics journals and requiring nothing beyond freshman mathematics to solve.

———. _More Mathematical Morsels_. (Dolciani Mathematical Expositions, no. 10.) Washington, DC: Mathematical Association of America, 1996. ISBN: 9780883853146.  
Similar in format to _Mathematical Morsels_, with 57 problems and somewhat more discussion of each problem. Most of the problems are taken from the journal _Crux Mathematicorum_.

———. _Mathematical Gems I_. (The Dolciani Mathematical Expositions, no. 1.) Washington, DC: Mathematical Association of America, 1974. ISBN: 9780883853016.

———. _Mathematical Gems III_. (Dolciani Mathematical Expositions, no. 9.) Washington, DC: Published and distributed by the Mathematical Association of America, 1997. ISBN: 9780883853184.  
Not really problem books but rather collections of mathematical essays on topics of interest to problem-solvers. However, many interesting problems are discussed.

———. _From Erdös to Kiev; Problems of Olympiad Caliber_. (Dolciani Mathematical Expositions, no. 17.) Washington, DC: Mathematical Association of America, 1997. ISBN: 9780883853245.

Klambauer, Gabriel. _Problems and Propositions in Analysis_. (Lecture Notes in Pure and Applied Mathematics, no. 49.) New York, NY: CRC, 1979. ISBN: 9780824768874.  
Several hundred problems and solutions in the four areas (a) arithmetic and combinatorics, (b) inequalities, (c) sequences and series, and (d) real functions. Difficulty ranges from easy to absurd. Includes some famous classical problems which are "well-known" but for which comprehensible complete solutions were impossible to find.

Klamkin, Murray S. _USA Mathematical Olympiads, 1972–1986_. (New Mathematical Library, no. 33.) Washington, DC: Mathematical Association of America, 1989. ISBN: 9780883856345.

Many easily stated but open problems. Also includes related exercises with solutions.

Konhauser, Joseph D. E., Daniel J. Velleman, and S. Wagon. _Which Way Did the Bicycle Go? And Other Intriguing Mathematical Mysteries_. (Dolciani Mathematical Expositions, no. 18.) Washington, DC: Mathematical Association of America, 1996. ISBN: 9780883853252.

Newman, Donald J. _A Problem Seminar_. Problem books in mathematics. New York, NY: Springer-Verlag, 1982. ISBN: 9780387907659.  
A wonderful collection of elegant and ingenious problems, arranged by subject. Each problem comes with a hint and a solution.

Pólya, George. _Problems and Theorems in Analysis 2. Theory of Functions, Zeros, Polynomials, Determinants, Number Theory, Geometry_. New York, NY: Springer, 2004. ISBN: 9783540636861.  
An English translation of a famous German classic. Develops the equivalent of a graduate level course in classical analysis (real and complex) based on problem solving. While many of the problems are too sophisticated for contests such as the Putnam Exam, there are still a large number of more accessible problems covering material almost impossible to learn otherwise.
